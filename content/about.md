My name is Yannis and I'm a former civil engineer turned data scientist turned data & cloud engineer. I enjoy learning and I wish I enjoyed cardio as much but that's a sad story.

I currently live in Brussels. In the past, I lived in Athens. I was born in Albania.

In this blog, I try to share topics and ideas I like. Hope you find something useful and interesting!
